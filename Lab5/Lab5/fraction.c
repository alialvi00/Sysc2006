   This means that:
   (1) if the numerator is equal to 0 the denominator is always 1.
   (2) if the numerator is not equal to 0 the denominator is always
       positive, and the numerator and denominator have no common
       divisors other than 1.

   In other words,
   (1) if the numerator is 0 the denominator is always changed to 1.
   (2) if the numerator and denominator are both negative, both values
       are made positive, or if the numerator is positive and the 
       denominator is negative, the numerator is made negative and the 
       denominator is made positive.
   (3) the numerator and denominator are both divided by their greatest
       common divisor.
